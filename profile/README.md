What is Cyphal?

Cyphal is an open technology for real-time intravehicular distributed computing and communication based on modern networking standards (Ethernet, CAN FD, etc.). It was created to address the challenge of on-board deterministic computing and data distribution in next-generation intelligent vehicles: manned and unmanned aircraft, spacecraft, robots, and cars.

The underlying Cyphal Specification is open to everyone, and it will always remain this way. No licensing or approval of any kind is necessary for its implementation, distribution, or use.
